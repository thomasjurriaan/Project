# An insight in Europe's integration

This repository has the aim to make a visualization of trade data from European countries.
It consists of two parts: a map and a line graph. Both are interactive and communicate with each other. It makes use of the D3 libary, and datamaps, which in turn relies heavily on D3's library.
I used the code of various websites,
1. The data was retrieved from: http://correlatesofwar.org/data-sets/bilateral-trade/international-trade-1870-2009-v3-0
2. A ine graph example from which I learned much can be found on: http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/building-a-multi-line-chart-using-d3js--cms-22935
3. The information on datamaps including chlororpleth and arcs can be found on: http://datamaps.github.io/
